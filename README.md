## Usage

> A simple front end interface to view your team's Slack messages. For use with hrr-18-doge-bot. Will persist data much longer than Slack's free service. Also provides basic search of messages.
> To use the bot, a user will need to navigate to https://api.slack.com/bot-users and register a new bot user for their Slack team.
> The bot must be deployed on Heroku to function. For a guide on deploying Slack bots to Heroku, refer to https://blog.heroku.com/how-to-deploy-your-slack-bots-to-heroku.

When making changes to the bot, the main file to pay attention to is bot.js. Almost everything else can be safely ignored. Also note that both the bot server and the ui server must be running for the program to work.

Also, refer to Slack's Real Time Messaging API for documentation on slack.rtm methods: https://api.slack.com/rtm
